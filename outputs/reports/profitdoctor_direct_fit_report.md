### How ProfitDoctor Could Potentially Solve This Specific Problem
ProfitDoctor can provide Shopify merchants with real-time profit tracking and COGS management, allowing them to identify the true costs associated with shipping and fulfillment. By integrating shipping cost analysis and highlighting hidden fees, ProfitDoctor can help merchants pinpoint which aspects of their fulfillment process are affecting their bottom line.

### Fit Rating
**8/10**  
ProfitDoctor directly addresses key concerns about profitability and hidden costs in the fulfillment process, making it a strong fit for the user's pain points. However, the specific focus on Canadian fulfillment may require additional regional insights or features to enhance its relevance further.

### Context (Original Post)
Hey everyone,
I’m curious how other Shopify sellers have experienced fulfillment as volume grew, especially when shipping to Canadian customers.
Not talking about ads or product selection — more the operational side:
storage decisions, shipping costs and delivery expectations, returns handling, packaging or prep surprises, carrier behavior, fees that only show up later
What worked fine at low volume but started to feel painful once orders picked up?
Genuinely curious what caught people off guard....
