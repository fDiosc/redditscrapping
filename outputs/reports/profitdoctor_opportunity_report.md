The user is facing issues with discount code abuse, where customers exploit offers by using multiple accounts for the same shipping address. This leads to potential revenue loss and complicates the management of promotional codes. The user is seeking efficient solutions to identify and manage such abuses without incurring significant costs or operational burdens.

ProfitDoctor could help the user by providing insights into the profitability of products sold through promotional codes, enabling the merchant to assess the impact of discount code abuse on their bottom line. By integrating real-time profit tracking and analyzing shipping costs, ProfitDoctor can help merchants understand the true cost of discounts provided and discern whether the profit margin is still viable despite potential abuses.

ProfitDoctor is not directly addressing the discount code abuse issue but offers valuable insights that can help mitigate the financial impact of such abuses. The integration of profit tracking with customer behavior data could enhance the user's ability to manage and enforce discount codes more effectively.

### Context (Original Post)
Hi all!
Quick question for Shopify store owners.
Have you run into cases where a discount code (welcome / influencer / promo) gets reused via multiple accounts (different emails/names) but the same shipping address?
If yes:

What rules do you use to decide "allow vs cancel/hold"?
Do you enforce anything by shipping address or only by customer/email?
Any lightweight workflow you would recommend (manual review, Flow, tagging, etc.)?

I’m trying to figure out what actually works in practice without going heavy/expensive....

Hi everyone,
I’m trying to figure out the best way to handle shipping notifications consistently in Shopify and would love to hear how others are doing this.
Currently, I’m using Shopify’s default notification emails (shipped / out for delivery / delivered) with fully customized HTML templates. These include:

Tracking links
Product installation & care info
Invoice link

That part works well.
For reviews, I’m using Judge.me, which sends its own emails. As far as I can tell, custom HTML isn’t really an option there, so those emails already look different — not ideal, but manageable.

The app is great, conditional logic, easy to build a template from scratch, and a really helpful team to problem solve when I was just starting.
