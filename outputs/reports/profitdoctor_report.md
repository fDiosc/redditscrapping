### 🤖 AI Product Analysis
### 1. User's Pain Point
The user is struggling with maintaining consistent email branding for shipping notifications, especially when using multiple tools that send out different styled emails. They are particularly concerned about failed delivery notifications and the lack of customization options in existing tools, leading to a disjointed customer experience.

### 2. How ProfitDoctor Could Potentially Solve This Problem
While ProfitDoctor primarily focuses on financial diagnostics, it could indirectly help this user by providing insights into the cost implications of shipping errors and failed deliveries. By tracking true profit and shipping costs, the user can better understand the financial impact of delivery issues and optimize their shipping strategies. Additionally, if ProfitDoctor were to integrate with email notification tools or offer insights on the costs of failed deliveries, it could enhance their decision-making process regarding communication strategies.

### 3. Fit Rating
**6/10**  
ProfitDoctor's core functionality does not directly address email design consistency, but it can provide valuable financial insights related to shipping and delivery issues that may arise from the user's current challenges.

### Original Summary
Hi everyone,
I’m trying to figure out the best way to handle shipping notifications consistently in Shopify and would love to hear how others are doing this.
Currently, I’m using Shopify’s default notification emails (shipped / out for delivery / delivered) with fully customized HTML templates. These include:

Tracking links
Product installation & care info
Invoice link

That part works well.
For reviews, I’m using Judge.me, which sends its own emails. As far as I can tell, custom HTML isn’t rea...

### 🤖 AI Product Analysis
### Brief Assessment of User's Pain Point
The user is experiencing potential fraudulent activity with multiple orders from the same individual using different names and addresses. This raises concerns about chargebacks, which could lead to account suspension on their payment processor (Stripe). The user is uncertain about how to handle the situation and protect their business from financial losses.

### How ProfitDoctor Could Potentially Solve This Problem
ProfitDoctor can help the user by providing real-time profit tracking and COGS management, enabling them to identify if these orders are genuinely profitable despite the risk of chargebacks. The tool can also analyze shipping costs and integrate ad spend data to ensure that all expenses are accounted for, helping the user make informed decisions about fulfilling or canceling suspicious orders. Moreover, by tracking overall profit margins, the user can assess the impact of potential chargebacks on their bottom line.

### Fit Rating
**8/10**  
While ProfitDoctor primarily focuses on profit tracking and cost management, the features can indirectly help address the user's concerns about fraud by providing insights that inform their decision-making process regarding the suspicious orders. However, it does not directly address the fraud detection aspect.

### Original Summary
So we got 12 orders paid by credit cards through our Stripe account. Before each order (almost each order) there were 4-5 attempts of transaction failures. All names of customers have same prefix (Rabie). All orders are prepaid. We have COD as well. This is a bit suspicious. I personally called 4 people. 3 never answered. No response to WhatsApp messages. One answered. But, he doesn't have any idea about the orders. We thought they're all kind of gifting. BTW, ours is an online books store in Du...

3. **Fit Rating**:

### Original Summary
Having trouble finding an app that doesnt use its own version of store credit to do this. I want an app that does this using customer accounts and Shopifys native store credit feature.
Main goal is to have a customer use a coupon code and then receive an amount of store credit (percentage of purchase) once we have received payment)
If anyone currently uses on that they like or know of one please let me know before i start installing a few dozen to try lol...

### Original Summary
Hey everyone,
I’m curious how other Shopify sellers have experienced fulfillment as volume grew, especially when shipping to Canadian customers.
Not talking about ads or product selection — more the operational side:
storage decisions, shipping costs and delivery expectations, returns handling, packaging or prep surprises, carrier behavior, fees that only show up later
What worked fine at low volume but started to feel painful once orders picked up?
Genuinely curious what caught people off guard...

### Original Summary
I've got a store I'm assisting that is based in Canada. They sell to both Canada and the US. The Gift Cards are based on their default currency, CAD. Is there a way to make it so there are 2 separate gift card products, one US one and one Canadian one, and the US one is set up in US currency (to the dollar), and they are shown to the two different markets? Right now if someone in the US wants to buy a $50 gift card, it's not really $50. Just makes things confusing....

Hi, all!
I have heard about POD shops having 30-90 day holds on them between order and release of funds. 
I'm wondering if this is a standard or something that happens from time-to-time.
Ideally, I'd like to go live with my shop sooner rather than later, but I don't have a way to fund a massive spike in orders if I have long holds (I'm not interested in taking out a line of credit) and I don't want to screw my customers or myself over with a bunch of orders that get cancelled. 
But if the initia...
