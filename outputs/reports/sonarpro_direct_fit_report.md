Everyone talks about validating ideas before you build, but the actual struggle is finding people who care enough to respond and give useful feedback without throwing hours at cold outreach.
I’m researching a tool that helps founders surface people already discussing a problem and start real conversations with them so you can test demand and get early adopters before you code anything.
If a product like that saved you time and helped you validate early ideas, would you pay $20-30/month for it?
Edit: A lot of the replies here raised good points around signal quality, trust, and avoiding noisy “...

12 months after launching my SaaS it crossed $100k in total revenue.
This was the third project of mine and a ton of work went into it.

For context, my SaaS is focused on product planning and development.

Hi everyone,
I love learning and I use ChatGPT daily to ask questions. But the format of ChatGPT answers make me frustrated. It's because they are often long, text-heavy, and visually dull.
We live in a visual world. Like most people my age, I consume information through YouTube, TikTok, and short-form content. In comparison, ChatGPT responses feel like academic papers or old-school Wikipedia pages. As a result, I don’t retain information very well.
That made me wonder "why can’t answers have visuals?"
So I built a tool for myself, an AI search engine that gives visual answers. Instead of long...

Curious how others actually do this day to day.
Do you rely on Upwork paid notifications, bots, manually check, or something else?
Do instant alerts actually matter to you for jobs that match what you do, or is checking periodically enough?
If you’ve tried any alert system before, what did you like about it and what would make it best for you? And does price usually become a barrier for tools like this?

I’m curious what’s actually working for SaaS companies right now when it comes to lead generation.
For a long time, inbound felt like the obvious answer — SEO, content, organic growth over time. Outbound often felt noisy or inefficient unless done really well.
But with search changing, AI flooding content, and competition increasing, I’m starting to see more teams re-evaluate that mix.
So I’m interested in real experiences, not theory:

Are you getting more traction from inbound or outbound right now?

Hello, Bart here!
Open source is becoming a legit GTM strategy for SaaS - not just a hobby project approach. I'm sure you know many of these examples: Supabase -> Firebase, Plausible -> Google Analytics, N8n -> Zapier and so on. 
We're going a similar path, but for wearables. Open Wearables is an open-source alternative to paid SaaS solutions (many wearables data aggregators charge $500+/mo and have usage-based pricing).
