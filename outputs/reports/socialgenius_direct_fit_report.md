Fala pessoal! Há algum tempo postei aqui sobre o SocialGenius, nossa ferramenta de IA que aprende o estilo real da marca para criar posts de Instagram.
Recebemos muitos feedbacks construtivos da comunidade (incluindo críticas sobre a interface e a complexidade de conexão) e passamos as últimas semanas mergulhados no código para resolver tudo.
O que mudou desde o último post?

I’m an independent music artist and I’m trying to stay OFF social media for my own sanity but still need to post consistently.
Id be looking for someone to:
Upload my Reels/TikToks
Use short captions I approve
Post at good times
Light comment replies (only important stuff)
Tell me if anything urgent pops off
That’s literally it. No editing. No filming. No strategy.
Just posting + light monitoring and I’d send all the content in batches at the start of the month....

I've been deep in the trenches managing Instagram growth for various niches (fitness, e-commerce, SaaS, personal brands) throughout 2025, and I wanted to share what's actually working vs. what everyone thinks works.
**What's WORKING in 2026:**

**Carousels > Reels for engagement** - Plot twist, I know. But carousel posts with educational content are getting 2-3x more saves and shares than quick Reels. The algorithm seems to favor content that keeps people ON the platform longer.
**Comment reply strategy** - Replying to every comment within the first 30 minutes is huge. But here's the hack: rep...

I know this tends to be a slower time for social media, but I'm a new SMM and still trying to get the hang of things. I'm noticing that my client's page is not performing the way it was a few months back when I first took over the account. Posts aren't getting nearly as many views, and nobody seems to be engaging no matter what I try. I had a meeting with my client the other day and they mentioned that the account's posts aren't really showing up in their personal feed anymore. I did an account check to see if it could be potentially shadowbanned or flagged but everything came up fine, so I'm ...

I’m currently building a new SaaS tool for social media marketing, but before I write another line of code, I want to make sure I’m actually solving real problems, not just "nice-to-haves."
What is that one specific task or bottleneck in your daily marketing work that feels like a total soul-crushing waste of time?

Curious what other social media folks are actually sticking with these days. As platforms keep tightening rules and detection, I’ve been trying to be more intentional about my tool stack instead of just hoarding subscriptions “just in case.” 
My job involves managing multiple brand accounts across different platforms and regions, and honestly, constant account switching has started to feel sketchy. Between logins, devices, IPs, cookies, and browser fingerprints, it feels way too easy to trigger weird behavior or get accounts flagged if you’re not careful. 
Because of that, I’m trying to build ...

I think there's an interesting discussion to be had about brand choices in terms of platform focuses(both organic and for ads), and where businesses are putting energy.
There's now more networks available than ever; though of course the same primaries still dominate many industries.
Facebook
Instagram
TikTok
YouTube
Threads
X(Twitter)
Bluesky
Linkedin
Reddit
Within healthcare a lot of focus is still within Linkedin/Facebook/Instagram depending on if you're B2B or D2C, but would be curious to hear how others are deciding(e.g. 1 channel represents awareness, another for ads/customers, etc) or if...

Most Instagram “growth hacks” say: post more, improve hooks, or comment on niche hashtags. But there is a pool of much warmer leads sitting under your competitors’ posts.
You know those posts like: “Comment ‘GUIDE’ and I’ll send it to your DMs”? Everyone in that comment section has already raised their hand saying “I want this solution”.
Here’s the strategy I’ve been testing:

Identify competitors who regularly post “comment X and I’ll DM you” offers in your niche.
Collect the users who comment or like those posts, because they are clearly interested in that topic or outcome.

Hey everyone,

Most of the existing tools are wuite dated or want you to sign up for stuff. So I figured, why not build something simple that just works :D
How it works:

Paste your website URL
AI analyzes your site (uses GPT-5.1 with web search)
It figures out what you do, who you serve, and what makes you different
Pick a tone (professional, bold, friendly, inspirational, minimal)
