Just a small intro, I’ve been building different products for the last couple of years, probably more than 4, but in the last year, I stuck with one in a large market with an already validated idea. It was quite simple social media scheduler (PostFast), but the goal was the make it so easy to use, that you don't even need onboarding.
It took me a few months before getting real customers in, but the thing is the slow tempo helped me fix a LOT of issues while building. To be honest, if a lot of people came in too early, I might’ve lost the product to bugs. It took a few months more to make it st...

Recently laid off 40 yr old here, with about 12 years of experience in B2B content marketing and business dev. I feel like my skillset can easily be matched by any driven 23-year-old, or even AI. I feel so generic and replaceable.
So I'm rethinking my next move. One option I’m considering is adding more hard or adjacent skills, like PPC / paid search, and going further into data-driven marketing by learning tools like Power BI. The idea is to stop being a generic content marketer and bring something more concrete to the table.
Another path I’m considering is specialization. I’ve worked across ...

I’m a sports analyst / tipster (football & basketball). I provide paid picks and analysis.
I’m looking for strong content ideas that:

don’t require showing my face
have viral potential
help attract new clients and potential sponsors

The goal is to build a professional, scalable sports brand, not just post random picks.
If you have experience with sports content, growth strategies, or faceless formats, I’d really appreciate any ideas or direction....

## I was tired of juggling AI tabs, so I built an app to chat with 120+ models from a single account

Hey all,
Over Christmas and New Year I spent most of my time building this app. It started as something I made purely for myself.
I was constantly switching between tabs and accounts just to ask questions to different LLMs, and it was killing my focus. I tried a bunch of AI chat apps, but they were missing a couple of things I really wanted:
• the ability to chat with multiple models at the same time
• the ability to have models respond or “debate” in parallel
So I decided to build it myself.
I launched it 2 days ago and currently have exactly 0 users, so I’d really appreciate any honest feedb...

i dont even know where to start… i have poured months of work, time, and money into my store, and now it’s all feeling like it’s slipping through my fingers.
apparently, disputifier the app i trusted to handle chargebacks automatically had a massive api leak. a hacker ran a script and triggered unauthorized refunds, literally taking over $12,000 from my store in seconds.
I feel helpless, frustrated, and tbh heartbroken. i thought relying on automated chargeback management would protect me, but now I’m wondering if any system is truly safe.
has anyone else been affected and how do you even reco...

Fala pessoal.
No começo do ano eu defini uma meta que parece loucura pra maioria: criar 12 projetos ao longo de 2026 com o objetivo de atingir 100k de receita recorrente mensal até dezembro.
O primeiro projeto já está funcionando. É uma plataforma de link in bio chamada linkmy.site.
A ideia surgiu de uma frustração de amigos. Eu vi criadores de conteúdo (que eu conheço, então conversei com eles) colocando um monte de link no perfil e não tendo a menor ideia de quem estava clicando, de onde vinha, o que funcionava ou não.
Então construí uma plataforma que resolve alguns desses problemas:

Estou aqui de novo pra levantar umas questões, talvez vocês já tenham passado por isso. Aliás, muito obrigado pelas ajudas que vocês tem dado nos comentários.
Eu e meu sócio estamos decidindo qual vai ser o modelo de cobrança pra gente poder seguir com o desenvolvimento da nossa plataforma que conecta psicólogos com clientes (www.HelloPsi.com). 
Temos algumas opções:
 - Cobrar mensalidade do psicólogo pra exibir ele nas buscas do site, independente se ele ganha cliente ou não no mês.
 - Cobrar 20% do valor de cada sessão que o cliente pagar na plataforma.
- Cobrar 50% da primeira sessão de um ...

Tenho 17 anos e criei um ERP SaaS para microempreendedores — feedbacks?

Fala, pessoal 👋
Me chamo Felipe, tenho 17 anos e desenvolvi um ERP SaaS que começou como projeto para meu futuro TCC e que pretendo evoluir para monetização.
Por enquanto, o sistema está totalmente gratuito, justamente para receber feedbacks reais.
O foco é em microempreendedores iniciantes (quem vende doce, faz bico, pequenos negócios) que hoje dependem de planilhas.
Atualmente dá pra gerenciar:

Clientes
Produtos
Despesas
Vendas
Pagamentos e parcelas

A ideia foi sair da lógica engessada de planilhas e criar algo m...

Shopify has released support for AI agents making purchases from your store.

If you think 25% chargeback rates from Amazon "Buy for Me" was bad, well just read this:
With UCP, agents can natively complete checkout on a customer’s behalf
Super, but Shopify must have made this opt in, right? Nope. From the sales channel settings page:
The global Shopify Catalog is your launchpad for AI shopping. It automatically uses your default product listing, no setup required.

Agentic Storefronts will be automatically enabled in your store

Eu continuo vendo muitos vídeos gerados por IA realmente ruins na área da saúde e em outras indústrias. Esses são anúncios pagos nas redes sociais que aparecem constantemente no meu feed. Eu entendo por que as empresas estão usando IA; é a ferramenta quente e da moda agora, mas quando você lê os comentários, as pessoas estão realmente detratando esses anúncios.
Sou designer gráfico e sou bastante contra o uso de IA como o principal motor criativo no marketing. Acho que a IA pode ser útil para coisas pequenas, como retoques em fotos ou ajuda na produção, mas quando ela se torna o centro de uma ...

I spend a lot of time gaming and it’s honestly the only thing I do most of the time.
I’m also in a situation where I need to start earning money, and college or the traditional route isn’t realistic for me right now.
I’m trying to know if there are realistic ways to earn online.
I’m not expecting “get rich quick” ideas, I’m willing to put in time and learn skills. I just don’t know where to start.
For people who make money online gaming related or not, what worked for you and what didnt?...
