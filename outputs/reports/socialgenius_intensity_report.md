Just a small intro, I’ve been building different products for the last couple of years, probably more than 4, but in the last year, I stuck with one in a large market with an already validated idea. It was quite simple social media scheduler (PostFast), but the goal was the make it so easy to use, that you don't even need onboarding.
It took me a few months before getting real customers in, but the thing is the slow tempo helped me fix a LOT of issues while building. To be honest, if a lot of people came in too early, I might’ve lost the product to bugs. It took a few months more to make it st...

12 months after launching my SaaS it crossed $100k in total revenue.
This was the third project of mine and a ton of work went into it.
It took me months to learn some important lessons and I thought I’d share just a few of them now to give you a chance to learn faster from what worked for me.

I have been seeing many founders trying to get better at validating ideas before building which is great, its what we should do, but that sadly doesnt make it easy.
I madde a post recently asking about what issues founders have with assessing demand and getting those first beta testers.
What surprised me was how consistent the frustrations were.
People are not struggling to come up with questions. They are struggling to find a small number of people who actually care enough to reply honestly.

Everyone talks about validating ideas before you build, but the actual struggle is finding people who care enough to respond and give useful feedback without throwing hours at cold outreach.
I’m researching a tool that helps founders surface people already discussing a problem and start real conversations with them so you can test demand and get early adopters before you code anything.
If a product like that saved you time and helped you validate early ideas, would you pay $20-30/month for it?

Recently laid off 40 yr old here, with about 12 years of experience in B2B content marketing and business dev. I feel like my skillset can easily be matched by any driven 23-year-old, or even AI. I feel so generic and replaceable.
So I'm rethinking my next move. One option I’m considering is adding more hard or adjacent skills, like PPC / paid search, and going further into data-driven marketing by learning tools like Power BI. The idea is to stop being a generic content marketer and bring something more concrete to the table.
Another path I’m considering is specialization. I’ve worked across ...

Hey everyone,
I run ChampSignal (competitive intelligence platform) and was doing keyword research when I noticed "mission statement generator" gets like 4,700 searches/month on Google.
Most of the existing tools are wuite dated or want you to sign up for stuff. So I figured, why not build something simple that just works :D
How it works:

Paste your website URL
AI analyzes your site (uses GPT-5.1 with web search)
It figures out what you do, who you serve, and what makes you different
Pick a tone (professional, bold, friendly, inspirational, minimal)

Hey Indie Hackers
I’ve been hacking on a small side project Chat Wrap that turns your chat history into a “Wrapped” style recap, just think of trends, patterns, and infographics that show how you communicate over time, not just stats for stats’ sake.
It started as a personal experiment. I was curious what I’d learn by looking at my own conversations aggregated over time who I talk to most, my tone shifts, late-night spirals, productivity bursts, etc. Turns out... it was way more interesting and a little confronting than I expected.
Now I’m stuck at a classic Indie Hacker crossroads:

Curious how others actually do this day to day.
Do you rely on Upwork paid notifications, bots, manually check, or something else?
Do instant alerts actually matter to you for jobs that match what you do, or is checking periodically enough?
If you’ve tried any alert system before, what did you like about it and what would make it best for you? And does price usually become a barrier for tools like this?
